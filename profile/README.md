## Hi there 👋 Welcome to the Environmental Data Engineering and Science (envdes) Laboratory!

🌍 **Established in 2022** by [Dr. Zhonghua Zheng](https://zhonghuazheng.com/) at The University of Manchester (UK), the **Environmental Data Engineering and Science (envdes) Lab** focuses on advancing both the **engineering** and **science** of environmental data.

We work at the interface of 🌫️ **air quality**, 🌆 **urban climate**, and 📊 **data-driven modelling**, aiming to develop open, actionable tools for a healthier and more sustainable planet.

## 🎯 Our Mission

To promote open and reproducible research in environmental data **engineering** and **science** through:

- 💻 Open-source software development  
- 🧮 Numerical model development and enhancement  
- 🤖 AI-driven model integration with physical simulations and real-world data 
- 🛠️ Scalable environmental data pipelines and infrastructure  

We believe that transparency and accessibility are key to enabling real-world impact.

## 🔬 What We Do

We investigate the **causes**, **estimation**, and **impacts** of:

- 🌆 **Urban climate dynamics and heat mitigation strategies**
- 🌫️ **Air pollution (e.g., ozone and fine particulate matter)**  

Our methods integrate:

- Physics-informed and data-driven approaches  
- Cloud-native and high-performance computing workflows  
- Open environmental datasets  

## 🤝 Get Involved

🌟 Stay open. Stay scalable. Stay impactful. We welcome collaborations across disciplines and sectors!
